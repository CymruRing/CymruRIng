### Hi there, 

Cymru is Welsh for Wales on account of my Welsh heritage.  However, my name is Dylan, and I am a full-stack software engineer currently seeking new employment opportunities. 🔭  I have a passion for technology and see software engineering as the key to making all the great things in science fiction a reality.
